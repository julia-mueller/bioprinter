TROUBLESHOOTING

Here we upload a list of frequently upcoming issues and how to solve them.

- Too few arguments
    --> try changing the stroke thickness, if it is 1pt, some vector graphic software does not include the stroke command to the .svg list and hence 1 argument is missing

- ModuleNotFoundError
    --> check if all files mentioned in the section "How to use?" of the README.md file are in your gel-printer folder
    
- python: can't open file 'executor.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directoy 
    --> check if you are in the correct folder in the command line, if not change your location with the command "cd path_to_the_correct_folder"
    --> check if the parameterfile that you try to use is in the folder "parameterfiles"
    --> check if the svg file, that you mentioned in the used parameterfile, is in the folder "svgfiles" 
    
- TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'
    --> check if all the numbers in the paramterfile are written in this format "2.0" and not "2,0" 
    
- IndexError: list index out of range
    --> check if your svg file has the correct format as given in the README.md file 
    
- printer is printing outside of your objectholder
    --> check if the stratdis is correct
    --> check if the offset is correct
    --> check if the origin is at the correct position of your svg file
    --> check if your design in the svg file has the correct dimensions (the python code reads in the numbers as millimeter)
    
- NameError: name '***' is not defined
    --> check if you are using Python 3.0 instead of another version (commonly Python 2.7) as some commands are different

- SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    --> check if you are using Python 3.0 instead of another version (commonly Python 2.7) as some commands are different
    --> check if your console allows you to include Python packages like import.math
